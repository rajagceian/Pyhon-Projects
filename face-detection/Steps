✅ Step 1: Install Python and OpenCV
Ensure Python is installed. You can check using:

cmd command -> python --version
If not installed, download and install Python from Python.org.

Install OpenCV using pip:

cmd command -> pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless  # If no display is required

✅ Step 2: Save the Script
Save your Python script with a .py extension (e.g., face_detection.py) in a directory, for example:

makefile
C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\face_detection.py
Place the image (raja.jpg) in the same directory.
